ㆍ In the meantime, I have taken the 'deep learning for everyone' season 2 courses, but with my short knowledge, I decided to combine them with season 1.  
So I started to watch the season 1 lectures as well.
ㆍ Deep learning for all season 1 - 1  
ㆍ The goals of the course  
1) Basic understadning of machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression(classification)  
2) Deep learning: Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks  
ㆍ Solve your problem using machine learning tools such as tensorflow and python.
