ㆍ Studied Deep learning for all season 1 lecture 15, 16  
ㆍ Softmax classification is very useful when predicting multiple classes  
ㆍ Tried to implement Softmax classification in Tensorflow version 2 following the lecture and codes, but I have not finished it yet.  
I'll finish it and upload at my Github tomorrow.
