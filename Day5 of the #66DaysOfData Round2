ㆍ In machine learning models, criteria are needed to determine how similar the actual and predicted values are, which is called the loss function.  
ㆍ Models can be broadly divided into regression and classification. Loss functions can also be divided accordingly.  
There are typical loss functions 'MAE', 'MSE', 'RMSE' for regression. On the other hand, we usually use cross-entropy for classification.   
MAE(Mean Absolute Error): It is easy to understand the degree to which the entire data is learned.  
However, Because absolute values are taken, it is difficult to determine how errors occur and whether they are negative or positive.  
Also, it is difficult to collect optimal values because the distance traveled is constant even when it is close to the optimal value.  
MSE(Mean Squared Error): It is the most commonly used loss function. Because of square, values smaller than 1 are becoming smaller and more are becoming larger.  
This is a disadvantage because it can cause distortion of the value.  
However, MSE is characterized by calculating the correct answer rate for other wrong answers in addition to the error of the correct answer rate for the actual value.  
In addition, unlike MAE, it is easy to converge to the optimal value because the distance traveled changes differently as you approach the optimal value.
