ㆍIt is important to realize that the most important factor in determining whether an application will be successful is often not which machine learning method you choose to use, but how you use it. The amount of the training data, the way the data is preprocessed and represented, the way the results are interpreted and applied. However, at some point the methods themselves may become the limiting factor. One such limit is the linearity of the model.
