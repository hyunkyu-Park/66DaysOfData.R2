This is a very simple challenge. There are only two requirements:

1. Learn data science for a minimum of 5 minutes per day for 66 days straight (consistency)
2. Share what you will be working on each day on the platform of your choice using #66DaysOfData (accountability)


__Day 1__

  ㆍThe difference between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression lies in what happens after the above linear function has been calculated. In Linear Regression, we are done and the Linear function is going to be the output. In Logistic Regression, we take the result of the Linear function and apply the specific non-linear function called the sigmoid function to it.  
  ㆍThe sigmoid function converts any number to value between 0 and 1. You can then use this to obtain a probability value.

  ㆍIt is important to realize that the most important factor in determining whether an application will be successful is often not which machine learning method you choose to use, but how you use it. The amount of the training data, the way the data is preprocessed and represented, the way the results are interpreted and applied. However, at some point the methods themselves may become the limiting factor. One such limit is the linearity of the model.  
  ㆍI have taught since last Thursday in Jincheon from elementary to high schools. I could feel that children are pretty exposed to AI but they barely aware they live with AI. In addition, students are very interested in learning and understanding AI than I thought they are. I think it's a good sign.
