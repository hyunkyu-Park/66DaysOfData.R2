ㆍWhile searching for sources for GAN, I learned about Professor Yann LeCun's NYU-deep learning lecture and I was going to study.  
However, I felt that it was still a little too much to follow the lecture, so I was able to find a lecture with a relatively low entry barrier called Deep Learning for All  
and started to learn.  
ㆍInterestingly, the first lecture was not about machine learning or deep learning, but about Docker settings.  
I didn't download it because I have not used Docker and I thought it could be replaced by a Jupiter laptop or Google COLAB.
