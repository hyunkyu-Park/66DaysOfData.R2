ㆍI read the overall article about deep learning. As I read about deep learning, the more I wondered what is meta-cognition.  
So I found and studied lectures on meta-cognition and 'Karl Dunker's problem' who asked questions about human scarcity.  
I used these new knowledge to High school who were not interested in AI and it was very effective.  
ㆍI did a class satisfaction survey in today's class (elementary and high school), and I was very proud that the results came out better than I expected.  
It's a shame that we can't upload pictures together because we can't share the results of the survey.
