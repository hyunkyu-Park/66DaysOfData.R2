„Üç Watched the 'Deep learning for all season 2 lecture' about Logistic regression to compare with season 1 lecture's codes.  
As far as I see, season 1 lectures are bit more natural and catchy, on the other hand, season 2 lectures feels more like releasing one's knowledge than a lecture.  
Of course, it is good that the style of the two lectures are different.
