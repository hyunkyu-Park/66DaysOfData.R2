ㆍ Studied Deep learning for all season 1 lecture 18  
ㆍ Standardization  
ㆍ Overfitting  
 -Our model is very good with training data set (with memorization)  
 -Not good at test dataset or in real use  
ㆍ Solution for overfitting   
 -More training data!  
 -Reduce the number of features  
 -Regularization
